		<h4>PUBG Mobile</h4>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<b style="font-size: 1em;">No Emulators</b>. The entire team is subject to disqualification even if one of the team members
				plays using an emulator.
			</li>
			<li>
				Spot Entry Fee: Rs. 250 (The players will have to buy Aether Day passes)
			</li>
			<li>
				No Spot Registrations/Entries after 13:30:00.
			</li>
			<li>
				There are two rounds based on a point system. The top few teams (see below) after both the rounds 
				will be qualified to play in the final round.
			</li>
			<li>
				The number of teams selected will depend on the number of registrations and hence, the number
				of lobbies created. The more lobbies created, the less number of teams per lobby selected for the final
				round. The number of teams selected for the final round will be between 10-15 overall.
			</li>
			<li>
				The reasoning behind two initial rounds is so that no team complains about landing in an unlucky spot.
				Even though luck is a factor in this game, we are trying to eliminate it with two rounds.
			</li>
			<li>
				Points System:<br>
				<ol>
					<li>
						The final team position will award a team:<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
						<span style="background-color: rgb(58, 58, 58);padding-left:1em; padding-right:0.5em;">
							2 x (N - (n-1))
						</span> points <br>
						N is number of teams in the lobby<br>
						n is the team's position<br><br>
						Ex: A team got 2<sup>nd</sup> place in a lobby with 20 teams.<br>
						This team will get:<br><br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;2 x (20 - (2-1)) points<br>
						= 2 x (19) points<br>
						= 38 points.<br>
					</li>
					<li>
						Each kill a player gets adds 2 points to the team.<br>
					</li>
				</ol><br>
				The total points after the two rounds will be added and the top select teams will be considered as qualified.
			</li>
			<li>
				The final round will <b style="font-size: 1em;"><u>not</u></b> be based on the points system. The team that gets the
				Chicken Dinner will have won the Tournament.
			</li>
			<li>
				Maps:<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round-1: Erangel<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round-2: Popularity Vote - Each Team gets one vote for any of the 4 maps<br><br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Final: Erangel
			</li>
			<li>
				Since Round-2 has a popularity vote for the map, all players must have all the 4 maps downloaded. If this is not
				possible, organizers must be informed before the vote begins.
			</li>
			<li>
				In case of any dispute, the organizers of PointBlanc have the final word and decision.
